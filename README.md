Cecrecy
=======

Small bundle to hide and show apps on SpringBoard. For the SBSettings Toggle, please look for SBCecrecy.

This executable is simply that - an executable. Without a toggle, the user's can't toggle it. This executable is bundled in an accessible location and can later be opened by other tweaks.

To have a sample to toggle it, please look into SBCecrecy.

If you want to compile this "standalone" with SBCecrecy (ie without downloading it from my repo), you need to download the Source code for Cecrecy and SBCecrecy. Make SBCecrecy a subproject of Cecrecy and add sbsettings as a dependency in Cecrecy's control file.
